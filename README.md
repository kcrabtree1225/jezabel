// Notes from Initial Meeting //

Environment – 1 stage, 4 doors (1 per side). Player cannot leave, waves of enemies generated procedurally.

Player – single character
    Attributes: Health (100), Armor ( start at 0 upgraded via items), Ammo (for weapons other than pistol)
    
Allies – max of two start with none

Enemies – Same attributes as player, one type for now. phase 1 is endless waves. Discuss later what to do with leftover enemies at the end of each wave.

Waves – phase 1 is endless. Possibly make each wave longer in length as the player progresses

Goals for phase 1 (completed in 2 weeks) - an endless fully functioning stage with 1 enemy type, 1 weapon, no upgrades or equipment.  Score, kills, timers, and status bars need to be functioning.

// Idea Box //

* Ally has a ‘vengeance’ attribute (0-100) that represents their percent chance to come back to avenge their death in the next round,   complete with their weapons (how much health, full?)

* Test push
